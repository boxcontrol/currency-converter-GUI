currency-converter-GUI
======================

This is currency converter with GUI, it uses your input to find current rates from 2 internet sources:

	- http://rate-exchange.appspot.com
	- http://themoneyconverter.com

First link is default and second link is with 'alt' added. If it does not find currency it will state 'None' in that field. 

For prerequisites to run this I suggest you read this:
